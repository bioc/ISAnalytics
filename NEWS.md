# ISAnalytics 1.2.1 (2021-06-08)

## MINOR UPDATES
* Added more default stats functions to `default_stats`
* Added optional automatic conversion of time points in months and years
when importing association file
* Minor fixes in `generate_Vispa2_launch_AF`

# ISAnalytics 1.1.11 (2021-05-11)

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `HSC_population_size_estimate` and `HSC_population_plot` allow estimates
on hematopoietic stem cell population size
* Importing of Vispa2 stats per pool now has a dedicated function,
`import_Vispa2_stats`
* `outlier_filter` and `outliers_by_pool_fragments` offer a mean to filter
poorly represented samples based on custom outliers tests

## VISIBLE USER CHANGES

* The argument `import_stats` of `aggregate_metadata` is officially deprecated
in favor of `import_Vispa2_stats`
* `aggregate_metadata` is now a lot more flexible on what operations can be
performed on columns via the new argument `aggregating_functions`
* `import_association_file` allows directly for the import of Vispa2 stats
and converts time points to months and years where not already present
* File system alignment of `import_association_file` now produces 3 separate
columns for paths
* `separate_quant_matrices` and `comparison_matrix` now do not require 
mandatory columns other than the quantifications - this allows for separation
or joining also for aggregated matrices

## FIXES

* Fixed a minor issue in `CIS_volcano_plot` that caused duplication of some
labels if highlighted genes were provided in input

# ISAnalytics 1.1.10 (2021-04-08)

## FIXES

* Fixed issue in `compute_near_integrations`: when provided recalibration
map export path as a folder now the function works correctly and produces
an automatically generated file name
* Fixed issue in `aggregate_metadata`: now paths to folder that contains
Vispa2 stats is looked up correctly. Also, VISPA2 stats columns are aggregated
if found in the input data frame independently from the parameter 
`import_stats`.

## IMPROVEMENTS

* `compute_abundance` can now take as input aggregated matrices and has
additional parameters to offer more flexibility to the user. Major updates
and improvements also on documentation and reproducible examples.
* Major improvements in function `import_single_Vispa2Matrix`: import is 
now preferentially carried out using `data.table::fread` greatly speeding up 
the process - where not possible `readr::read_delim` is used instead
* Major improvements in function `import_association_file`: greatly improved
parsing precision (each column has a dedicated type), import report now 
signals parsing problems and their location and signals also
problems in parsing dates.
Report also includes potential problems in column names and signals missing
data in important columns. Added also the possibility to give various file 
formats in input including `*.xls(x)` formats.
* Function `top_integrations` can now take additional parameters to compute
top n genes for each specified group
* Removed faceting parameters in `CIS_volcano_plot` due to poor precision
(easier to add faceting manually) and added parameters to return the 
data frame that generated the plot as an additional result. Also, it is 
now possible to specify a vector of gene names to highlight even if they're
not above the annotation threshold.

## MINOR

* ISAnalytics website has improved graphic theme and has an additional button
on the right that leads to the devel (or release) version of the website
* Updated vignettes

## FOR DEVS ONLY

* Complete rework of test suite to be compliant to testthat v.3

# ISAnalytics 1.1.9 (2021-02-17)

## FIXES

* Fixed minor issues in internal functions with absolute file paths & corrected
typos

# ISAnalytics 1.1.8 (2020-02-15)

## FIXES

* Fixed minor issues in internal functions to optimize file system alignment


# ISAnalytics 1.1.7 (2020-02-10)

## FIXES

* Fixed minor issues in import_association_file when checking parameters

# ISAnalytics 1.1.6 (2020-02-06)

## UPGRADES

* It is now possible to save html reports to file from 
import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices_auto and 
import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices_interactive, remove_collisions and 
compute_near_integrations

## FIXES

* Fixed sample_statistics: now functions that have data frame output do not
produce nested tables. Flat tables are ready to be saved to file or can be
nested.
* Simplified association file check logic in remove_collisions: now 
function blocks only if the af doesn't contain the needed columns

# ISAnalytics 1.1.5 (2020-02-03)

## UPGRADES

* Upgraded import_association_file function: now file alignment is not
mandatory anymore and it is possible to save the html report to file
* Updated vignettes and documentation

# ISAnalytics 1.1.4 (2020-11-16)

## UPGRADES

* Greatly improved reports for collision removal function
* General improvements for all widget reports

# ISAnalytics 1.1.3 (2020-11-10)

## FIXES

* Further fixes for printing reports when widgets not available
* Added progress bar to collision processing in `remove_collisions`
* Updated vignettes

## NEW

* Added vignette "Using ISAnalytics without RStudio support"

# ISAnalytics 1.1.2 (2020-11-05)

## FIXES

* Fixed missing restarts for non-blocking widgets

# ISAnalytics 1.1.1 (2020-11-04)

## FIXES

* Functions that make use of widgets do not interrupt execution anymore if 
errors are thrown while producing or printing the widgets
* Optimized widget printing for importing functions
* If widgets can't be printed and verbose option is active, reports are now 
displayed on console instead (needed for usage in environments that do not 
have access to a browser)
* Other minor fixes (typos)
* Bug fixes: fixed a few bugs in importing and recalibration functions
* Minor fix in import_association_file file function: added multiple strings
to be translated as NA

## IMPORTANT NOTES

* Vignette building might fail due to the fact that package "knitcitations" 
is temporarily unavailable through CRAN
* ISAnalytics is finally in release on bioconductor!
