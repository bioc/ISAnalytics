* Added package logo

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

* Changed algorithm for `compute_near_integrations`
* Added support for multi-quantification matrices to `remove_collisions`
* Added usage of lifecycle badges in documentation: users can now see if 
a feature is experimental/maturing/stable etc
