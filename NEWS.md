    `vignette("report_system", package = "ISAnalytics")`
-   Old `ISAnalytics.widgets` option has been replaced by
    `ISAnalytics.reports`
-   In `remove_collisions()`, removed arguments `seq_count_col`,
    `max_rows_reports` and `save_widget_path`, added arguments

    in \*.tsv format
-   `CIS_grubbs()` now supports calculations for each group specified in

-   Fixed minor issue with NA values in alluvial plots

## DEPRECATIONS

-   `import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices_interactive()` and

    favor of `import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices()`

## OTHER

-   The package has now a more complete and functional example data set
    for executable examples
-   Reworked documentation

# ISAnalytics 1.3.2 (2021-06-28)

## FIXES

-   Corrected issues in man pages

# ISAnalytics 1.3.1 (2021-06-24)

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

-   `is_sharing` computes the sharing of IS between groups
-   `sharing_heatmap` allows visualization of sharing data through
    heatmaps
-   `integration_alluvial_plot` allows visualization of integration
    sites distribution in groups over time.
-   `top_abund_tableGrob` can be used in combination with the previous
    function or by itself to obtain a summary of top abundant
    integrations as an R graphic (tableGrob) object that can be combined
    with plots.

## MINOR UPDATES

-   Added more default stats functions to `default_stats`
-   Added optional automatic conversion of time points in months and
    years when importing association file
-   Minor fixes in `generate_Vispa2_launch_AF`

# ISAnalytics 1.1.11 (2021-05-11)

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

-   `HSC_population_size_estimate` and `HSC_population_plot` allow
    estimates on hematopoietic stem cell population size
-   Importing of Vispa2 stats per pool now has a dedicated function,
    `import_Vispa2_stats`
-   `outlier_filter` and `outliers_by_pool_fragments` offer a mean to
    filter poorly represented samples based on custom outliers tests

## VISIBLE USER CHANGES

-   The argument `import_stats` of `aggregate_metadata` is officially
    deprecated in favor of `import_Vispa2_stats`
-   `aggregate_metadata` is now a lot more flexible on what operations
    can be performed on columns via the new argument
    `aggregating_functions`
-   `import_association_file` allows directly for the import of Vispa2
    stats and converts time points to months and years where not already
    present
-   File system alignment of `import_association_file` now produces 3
    separate columns for paths
-   `separate_quant_matrices` and `comparison_matrix` now do not require
    mandatory columns other than the quantifications - this allows for
    separation or joining also for aggregated matrices

## FIXES

-   Fixed a minor issue in `CIS_volcano_plot` that caused duplication of
    some labels if highlighted genes were provided in input

# ISAnalytics 1.1.10 (2021-04-08)

## FIXES

-   Fixed issue in `compute_near_integrations`: when provided
    recalibration map export path as a folder now the function works
    correctly and produces an automatically generated file name
-   Fixed issue in `aggregate_metadata`: now paths to folder that
    contains Vispa2 stats is looked up correctly. Also, VISPA2 stats
    columns are aggregated if found in the input data frame
    independently from the parameter `import_stats`.

## IMPROVEMENTS

-   `compute_abundance` can now take as input aggregated matrices and
    has additional parameters to offer more flexibility to the user.
    Major updates and improvements also on documentation and
    reproducible examples.
-   Major improvements in function `import_single_Vispa2Matrix`: import
    is now preferentially carried out using `data.table::fread` greatly
    speeding up the process - where not possible `readr::read_delim` is
    used instead
-   Major improvements in function `import_association_file`: greatly
    improved parsing precision (each column has a dedicated type),
    import report now signals parsing problems and their location and
    signals also problems in parsing dates. Report also includes
    potential problems in column names and signals missing data in
    important columns. Added also the possibility to give various file
    formats in input including `*.xls(x)` formats.
-   Function `top_integrations` can now take additional parameters to
    compute top n genes for each specified group
-   Removed faceting parameters in `CIS_volcano_plot` due to poor
    precision (easier to add faceting manually) and added parameters to
    return the data frame that generated the plot as an additional
    result. Also, it is now possible to specify a vector of gene names
    to highlight even if they’re not above the annotation threshold.

## MINOR

-   ISAnalytics website has improved graphic theme and has an additional
    button on the right that leads to the devel (or release) version of
    the website
-   Updated vignettes

## FOR DEVS ONLY

## FIXES

-   Fixed minor issues in internal functions with absolute file paths &
    corrected typos

# ISAnalytics 1.1.8 (2020-02-15)

## FIXES

-   Fixed minor issues in internal functions to optimize file system
    alignment

-   Fixed sample_statistics: now functions that have data frame output
    do not produce nested tables. Flat tables are ready to be saved to
    file or can be nested.
-   Simplified association file check logic in remove_collisions: now
    function blocks only if the af doesn’t contain the needed columns

# ISAnalytics 1.1.5 (2020-02-03)

## UPGRADES

-   Upgraded import_association_file function: now file alignment is not
    mandatory anymore and it is possible to save the html report to file
-   Updated vignettes and documentation

## FIXES

-   Functions that make use of widgets do not interrupt execution
    anymore if errors are thrown while producing or printing the widgets
-   Optimized widget printing for importing functions
-   If widgets can’t be printed and verbose option is active, reports
    are now displayed on console instead (needed for usage in
    environments that do not have access to a browser)
-   Other minor fixes (typos)
-   Bug fixes: fixed a few bugs in importing and recalibration functions
-   Minor fix in import_association_file file function: added multiple
    strings to be translated as NA
