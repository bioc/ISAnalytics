ISAnalytics is an R package developed to analyze gene therapy vector
insertion sites data identified from genomics next generation sequencing
reads for clonal tracking studies.

In gene therapy, stem cells are modified using viral vectors to deliver
the therapeutic transgene and replace functional properties since the
genetic modification is stable and inherited in all cell progeny. The
retrieval and mapping of the sequences flanking the virus-host DNA
junctions allows the identification of insertion sites (IS), essential
for monitoring the evolution of genetically modified cells in vivo. A
comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of IS is required to foster
clonal trackign studies and supporting the assessment of safety and long
term efficacy in vivo. This package is aimed at (1) supporting
automation of IS workflow, (2) performing base and advance analysis for
IS tracking (clonal abundance, clonal expansions and statistics for
insertional mutagenesis, etc.), (3) providing basic biology insights of
transduced stem cells in vivo.

# NEWS

# ISAnalytics 1.0.10 (2021-02-17)

## FIXES

  - Fixed minor issues in internal functions with absolute file paths &
    corrected typos

# ISAnalytics 1.0.9 (2021-02-15)

## FIXES

  - Fixed minor issues in internal functions to optimize file system
    alignment

# ISAnalytics 1.0.8 (2021-02-10)

## FIXES

  - Fixed minor issues in import\_association\_file when checking
    parameters

# ISAnalytics 1.0.7 (2021-02-06)

## UPGRADES

  - It is now possible to save html reports to file from
    import\_parallel\_Vispa2Matrices\_auto and
    import\_parallel\_Vispa2Matrices\_interactive, remove\_collisions
    and compute\_near\_integrations

## FIXES

  - Fixed sample\_statistics: now functions that have data frame output
    do not produce nested tables. Flat tables are ready to be saved to
    file or can be nested.
  - Simplified association file check logic in remove\_collisions: now
    function blocks only if the af doesn’t contain the needed columns

# ISAnalytics 1.0.6 (2021-02-03)

## UPGRADES

  - Upgraded import\_association\_file function: now file alignment is
    not mandatory anymore and it is possible to save the html report to
    file
  - Updated vignettes and documentation

# ISAnalytics 1.0.5 (2020-11-16)

## UPGRADES

  - Greatly improved reports for collision removal functionality
  - General improvements for all widget reports

# ISAnalytics 1.0.4 (2020-11-10)

## FIXES

  - Further fixes for printing reports when widgets not available
  - Added progress bar to collision processing in `remove_collisions`
  - Updated vignettes

## NEW

  - Added vignette “Using ISAnalytics without RStudio support”

# ISAnalytics 1.0.3 (2020-11-05)

## FIXES

  - Fixed missing restarts for non-blocking widgets

# ISAnalytics 1.0.2 (2020-11-04)

## FIXES

  - Functions that make use of widgets do not interrupt execution
    anymore if errors are thrown while producing or printing the widgets
  - Optimized widget printing for importing functions
  - If widgets can’t be printed and verbose option is active, reports
    are now displayed on console instead (needed for usage in
    environments that do not have access to a browser)
  - Other minor fixes (typos)
