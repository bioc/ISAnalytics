\title{Import integration matrices based on the association file.}
\usage{
import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices_auto(
  association_file,
  quantification_type,
  matrix_type = "annotated",
  workers = 2,
  multi_quant_matrix = TRUE,
  export_report_path = NULL,
  patterns = NULL,
  matching_opt = matching_options(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{association_file}{A single string containing the path to the
association file on disk, or a data frame resulting from a previous call to
\code{import_association_file}}

\item{quantification_type}{A vector of requested quantification_types. Must
be one in \code{quantification_types()}}

\item{matrix_type}{A single string representing the type of matrices to
be imported. Can only be one in \code{"annotated"} or \code{"not_annotated"}}

\item{workers}{A single integer representing the number
of parallel workers to use for the import}

\item{multi_quant_matrix}{If set to TRUE will produce a
multi-quantification matrix (data frame) through \code{comparison_matrix}
instead of a list.}

\item{export_report_path}{A path on disk to save produced import report
or NULL if the user doesn't wish to save the html file}

\item{patterns}{A character vector of additional patterns to match on file
names. Please note that patterns must be regular expressions. Can be NULL if
no patterns needs to be matched.}

\item{matching_opt}{A single value between \code{matching_options}}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[rlang:dyn-dots]{dynamic-dots}}> Additional named arguments
to pass to \code{Ã¬mport_association_file} and \code{comparison_matrix}}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames containing data from
all imported integration
matrices, divided by quantification type or a multi-quantification matrix
}
\description{
\lifecycle{maturing}
These functions are designed to import the appropriate
integration matrix files given the association file and the root folder of
the file system where Vispa2 matrices are generated.
}
\details{
Import family functions are designed to work in combination with
Vispa2, for more details on this take a look here:
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702242/}{VISPA2:
A Scalable Pipeline for High-Throughput Identification
and Annotation of Vector Integration Sites}.\cr
For more details on how to properly use these functions, refer to the
vignette - vignette("how_to_import_functions")

\section{Automatic version}{

The automatic version of import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices doesn't interact with
the user directly, for this reason options in this modality are more limited
compared to the interactive version. In automatic version you can't:
\itemize{
\item Choose single projects or pools: to have a selection import
the association file first and filter it according to your needs
before calling the function
(more details on this in the vignette)
\item Choose duplicates: if, after filtering by the specified patterns,
duplicates are found they are automatically ignored
}
}

\section{Interactive version}{

The interactive version of import_parallel_Vispa2Matrices asks user for input
and allows a more detailed choice of projects to import, pools to import and,
if necessary, duplicate files. During the execution, a series of reports is
shown in html format.
